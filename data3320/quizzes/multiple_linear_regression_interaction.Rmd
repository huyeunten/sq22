```{r}
library(tidyverse)
cars <- read_csv("mtcars12.csv")
```
```{r}

```{r}

```

1. The estimated coefficients are 29.93 for the slope, -3.44 for weight, 12.60 for transmission, and -4.25 for the combined weight and transmission.
2. Yes, the difference is significant. The p-value for the interaction is 0.00255, which is less than 0.05.
