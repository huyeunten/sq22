```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(leaps)
cars <- read_csv("mtcars7.csv")
```

```{r}
regfit_cars <- regsubsets(mpg ~ ., data = cars, nvmax = 10)
summary <- summary(regfit_cars)
```

```{r}
plot(summary$bic, type = "b", xlab = "Number of Variables", ylab = "BIC")
```

```{r}
summary$outmat
```

The model that minimizes the BIC has four predictors. They are wt, vs, am, and carb.
